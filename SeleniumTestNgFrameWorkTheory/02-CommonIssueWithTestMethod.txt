If u create a test method in src/main/java , then u will get error with the statement
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

This is because of the dependencies which ever we added , they have scope tag which by default will be set as
<scope>test</scope>

this is because we can create test method in src/test/java folder without issues

We can also create the Test methods in src/main/java , if we change this scope parameter in the dependency of pom.xml file
<scope>compile</scope>
Then refresh maven project
Now dependency issue will be resolved

if we want to create Test methods in src/main/java - then only change to this <scope>compile</scope>

if we want to create Test methods in src/test/java - then keep it default - <scope>test</scope>
